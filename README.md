## What?

London Crypto Day is a full day of talks and discussion about cryptography.  The
event aims to provide interesting talk content, and create a space for
cryptographers and cryptography enthusiasts alike to come together and network
with like-minded people, who are either working or interested in similar areas
to themselves.

The event will include a selection of talks from both academia and industry, and
there will be plenty of time to socialize and network with other attendees.
